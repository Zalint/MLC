# Fix: Suppress 404 Errors for Missing Attachments

## Problem
When loading the Orders page, the frontend was making individual API calls to fetch attachments for each order. This caused:
- **Multiple 404 errors** when orders had no attachments (endpoint not found or no attachments exist)
- **Rate limiting errors (429)** due to simultaneous requests
- **Console pollution** with error messages for expected scenarios

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling for 404 Responses
Updated `getAttachments()` and `getAttachmentsCount()` functions to:
- Return empty array/zero count when receiving 404 status (normal behavior for orders without attachments)
- Suppress console logging for 404 errors
- Only log unexpected errors

### 2. Added Rate Limiting Retry Logic
Created `fetchWithRetry()` helper function that:
- Automatically retries requests when hitting rate limits (429 status)
- Implements exponential backoff with 1-second delay
- Supports up to 2 retries by default
- Handles network errors with retry logic

### 3. Code Changes Summary

#### File: `frontend/js/attachments.js`

**Added Constants:**
```javascript
const MAX_RETRIES = 2;
const RETRY_DELAY = 1000; // 1 seconde
```

**New Function:**
```javascript
async function fetchWithRetry(url, options, retries = MAX_RETRIES)
```
- Handles 429 rate limiting with automatic retry
- Handles network errors with retry
- Configurable retry count

**Updated Functions:**

1. **`getAttachments(orderId)`**
   - Now uses `fetchWithRetry()` instead of direct `fetch()`
   - Returns `{ success: true, data: [] }` for 404 responses
   - Silently handles 404 errors (no console logging)

2. **`getAttachmentsCount(orderId)`**
   - Now uses `fetchWithRetry()` instead of direct `fetch()`
   - Returns `0` for 404 responses
   - Silently handles all errors

## Benefits

✅ **No more console pollution** - 404 errors for missing attachments are handled gracefully
✅ **Better rate limit handling** - Automatic retry with backoff
✅ **Improved UX** - No visible errors for expected scenarios
✅ **More resilient** - Network errors are handled with retries
✅ **Cleaner logs** - Only real errors are logged to console

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with orders without attachments**: Verify no 404 errors in console
2. **Test with many orders**: Verify rate limiting is handled gracefully
3. **Test attachment upload**: Verify existing functionality still works
4. **Test attachment download**: Verify existing functionality still works
5. **Test slow network**: Verify retry logic works properly

## Production Deployment Notes

⚠️ **Important**: The attachments endpoint may still need to be properly deployed to production:
- Verify route is registered in `backend/app.js`
- Confirm `attachmentController.js` is deployed to Render
- Check that attachments endpoint is exempt from rate limiting (as per comment in app.js line 85)
